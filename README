I wrote a little Linux driver based on Andy Wingo's work (http://wingolog.org/pub/nvbacklight-0.1.tar.bz2) and MacTel Team (https://launchpad.net/~mactel-suppor..._filter=karmic) that enables the control of laptop backlight connected to NVIDIA chip using the /sys/class/backlight interface.
Kubuntu 9.10 for instance uses this interface to send back backlight control button events.
It is tested with a Sony AW11M/H laptop (Nvidia 9300M GS). Other users successfully tested it on other laptops as you can see in this topic.
If you use Ubuntu, you can simply install the attached nvidiabl-dkms_xxxx_all.deb file.
If not already done, install DKMS, for instance with Ubuntu:

sudo aptitude update && sudo aptitude install dkms

If you installed a previous nvbacklight, nvidia_bl or nvidiabl driver, check if some old versions are still present:

dkms status

It gives me:

vboxhost, 3.2.10, 2.6.35-22-generic, x86_64: installed  (WARNING! Diff between built and installed module!) (WARNING! Diff between built and installed module!) (WARNING! Diff between built and installed module!)
nvidiabl, 0.56, 2.6.35-22-generic, x86_64: installed 
nvidia-current, 260.19.06, 2.6.35-22-generic, x86_64: installed 
nvidia-current, 260.19.06, 2.6.32-25-generic, x86_64: built

Remove any old version, in that case:

sudo dkms remove -m nvidiabl -v 0.56 --all

Be aware that the driver name has been changed recently from nvidia_bl to nvidiabl to prevent some DKMS parsing problems.
If you downloaded and uncompressed directly the 0.57 source, make a link to the source, for instance:

sudo ln -s ~/nvidiabl /usr/src/nvidiabl-0.57

Or if you downloaded the nvidiabl-0.57-source-only.dkms.tar.gz file:

sudo dkms ldtarball --archive=nvidiabl-0.57-source-only.dkms.tar.gz

Add, build and install the module:

sudo dkms add build install -m nvidiabl -v 0.57

The driver autoloads for Sony Vaio VGN AW11, FZ11 and FZ38 laptops and other laptops, have a look in the "nvidiabl-laptops.h" file.
To load the driver manually, you need to add a line containing "nvidiabl" in "/etc/modules".
If you want the driver to autoload for your laptop without adding a line to "/etc/modules", please give me the output of:

lspci -nn
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/sys_vendor
cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_name

If you know Linux driver programming, you can then modify yourself the "nvidiabl-laptops.h" and send me the line you added.
You can debug the driver with the following options:

module_param_named(off, off, long, 0644);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(off, "value to put in the register to disable the backlight");

module_param_named(min, min, long, 0644);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(min, "minimum register value for the backlight");

module_param_named(max, max, long, 0644);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(max, "maximum register value for the backlight");

module_param_named(pci_id, pci_id, ulong, 0644);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(pci_id, "PCI ID of the Nvidia card - usefull only when not using autodetection and more than one Nvidia PCI device");

and

module_param_named(model, model, charp, 0644);
MODULE_PARM_DESC(model, "backlight model, must be empty for autodetection, nv4x or nv5x");

I attached too some ACPI scripts examples that permit on my laptop to use Fn keys to change the backlight value. There is an intereting script here too: http://dev.osource.se/software/obacklight/.

nVidia staff is of course free to ship this driver with theirs!
